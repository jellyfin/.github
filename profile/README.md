[Jellyfin is the Free Software Media System](https://jellyfin.org) that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media.

Jellyfin provides media streaming from a dedicated, self-hosted server to end-user devices via multiple client apps or the web.
The [Jellyfin server](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin) is built on the .NET Core framework to enable full cross-platform
operation, and supports multiple flavours of Linux, Windows, and MacOS as a server. Plugins, both 1st and 3rd party, provide
additional functionality for everything from reporting, to additional metadata, to authentication. We provide clients for many
common devices including [Web browsers](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-web), [Android](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-android)
and [iOS](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-expo) Smartphones, [AndroidTV](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-androidtv) (including Amazon FireTV),
[Roku](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-roku), and many more.

With Jellyfin, there are no strings attached, no premium licenses or features, no centralized servers, and no cost to you. Our team is entirely
volunteer-driven and committed to building the best possible community-focused [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
media solution. We welcome anyone who is interested in joining us in that quest!
